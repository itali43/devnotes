# devnotes: Random notes from development's many adventures


#### This should be a non-exhaustive list of notes I think are worth keeping during development.  Aim is for them to be pretty baseline as I think writing and repetition are the best way to remember mundane things.

### VI / VIM
- ```[esc] gg``` takes you to the front of a vi'd document; ```[esc]gD``` from there will delete everything within it
- [Here's a list of vim vocab that may come in handy if you see something you don't understand](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/digraph.html#digraph-table)

### Git
- ```git checkout [branch name]``` moves you to that branch, and should create a new one if the name doesn't exist
- ```git fetch; git rebase``` is a really nice way to update a local after the remote has been changed, careful, it is permanent.
